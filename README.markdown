# decay

[http://github.com/goerz/decay](http://github.com/goerz/decay)

The decay program is a computer version of a high school lab experiment in
which a board of dice is used to analyze radioactive decay. There is the
possibility to include up to four unstable isotopes in a decay process.

## Install ##

No install necessary. Download the executables and run them in a DOS prompt.

## Usage ##

Run any of the four variations of the program:

    DECAY.EXE       - Program that simulates the radioactive decay from a
                      radioactive parent-atom to a stable daughter-atom

    DECAY2.EXE      - Program that simulates the radiative decay from a
                      radioactive parent-atom to a stable daughter-atom
                      with up to 4 unstable daughter-atoms in between.

    DECAY_S.EXE     - Program that simulates the radioactive decay from a
                      radioactive parent-atom to a stable daughter-atom.
                      This programs accepts only the path "A:\REPORTS\..."
                      for the report-file in order to prevent the user to
                      overwrite a file on the hard-disc

    DECAY2_S.EXE    - Program that simulates the radiative decay from a
                      radioactive parent-atom to a stable daughter-atom
                      with up to 4 unstable daughter-atoms in between.
                      This programs accepts only the path "A:\REPORTS\..."
                      for the report-file in order to prevent the user to
                      overwrite a file on the hard-disc

The program will record the number of all isotopes for each throw in the output
file, for analysis.
